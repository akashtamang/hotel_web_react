            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Our homestay began in 2011, started and managed by our own family with love and dedication. In the early days, there were only two homestays in our area — ours and one run by our neighbor. We started small, welcoming guests into our home and sharing our way of life. <br /> <br />

                Farming has always been at the heart of what we do. Most of the food we serve comes directly from our own fields — fresh, seasonal, and full of local flavor. As proud members of the Tamang community, we love sharing our culture, traditions, and warm hospitality with every guest who visits us.</p>
